Major bugs from today:

- x-button was not capturing the hover/click function properly
		- SOLUTION: need to use classes rather than IDs
- could not access / scroll sideways on the gallery
		- other elements were on top / blocking it
		- SOLUTION: move all 'hidden' elements to z-position -1, which affects both visibility AND interaction capabilities
		- *IMPORTANT: need to have position: relative or absolute defined for z-index to take affect
- git doesn't push properly?
		- make another change ... check which branch is currently in use
